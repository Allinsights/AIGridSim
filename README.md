# AIGridSim
Probabilistic Cost Analysis of Installing PV and Storage using Simulation

AIGridSim takes four types of input files, those should be placed under AIGridSim/data:

-1) A file named Param.csv specifying the different parameters for the current analysis

-2) A file named Electric_Rates.csv specifying the different costs for electricity supply

-3) Histrorical Demand and Irradation files named Irradiadtion_i.csv and Demand_i.csv where i = 0..nb_years_analysis, each file contains an hourly input of total load and irradiation for a whole year, see the given files for an example.

Based on historcal data and cost inputs, AIGridSim can estimate the cost savings generated by installing PV and/or Batteries given your input parameters such as demand increase rate, inflation rate and time horizon.
